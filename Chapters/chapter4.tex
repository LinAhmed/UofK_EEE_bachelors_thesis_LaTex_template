\section{Adding a teble}

In the same way as in figures, you can mention any table through it's label using the "hash ref" as showing below:

The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:comparison}. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, which are analyzed below.

% For adding a table, use the following code: 

\begin{table}[htbp] 
    \centering
    \caption{Comparison of Different Methods} %This is the title of the table
    \label{tab:comparison}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Accuracy (\%)} & \textbf{Processing Time (ms)} & \textbf{Memory Usage (MB)} \\
        \midrule
        Method A & 95.2 & 120 & 256 \\
        Method B & 93.8 & 85 & 312 \\
        Method C & 97.1 & 150 & 428 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
